This abstraction also allows the framework to add additional improvements that you can easily take advantage of.  x3Ca href=x22http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163329.aspxx22x3EPLINQx3C/ax3E is an example of adding multi-threading support to LINQ.  Code changes are minimal to add this support.  It would be MUCH harder to do this data access code that simply calls sprocs.x3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Ex3Cstrongx3EDebugging supportx3C/strongx3E: I can use any .NET debugger to debug the queries.  With sprocs, you cannot easily debug the SQL and that experience is largely tied to your database vendor (MS SQL Server provides a query analyzer, but often that isnx27t enough).x3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Ex3Cstrongx3EVendor agnosticx3C/strongx3E: LINQ works with lots of databases and the number of supported databases will only increase.  Sprocs are not always portable between databases, either because of varying syntax or feature support (if the database supports sprocs at all).x3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Ex3Cstrongx3EDeploymentx3C/strongx3E: Others have mentioned this already, but itx27s easier to deploy a single assembly than to deploy a set of sprocs.  This also ties in with #4.x3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Ex3Cstrongx3EEasierx3C/strongx3E: You donx27t have to learn T-SQL to do data access, nor do you have to learn the data access API (e.g. ADO.NET) necessary for calling the sprocs.  This is related to #3 and #4.x3C/lix3E\nx3C/olx3E\n\nx3Cpx3ESome disadvantages of LINQ vs sprocs:x3C/px3E\n\nx3Colx3E\nx3Clix3Ex3Cstrongx3ENetwork trafficx3C/strongx3E: sprocs need only serialize sproc-name and argument data over the wire while LINQ sends the entire query.  This can get really bad if the queries are very complex.  However, LINQx27s abstraction allows Microsoft to improve this over time.x3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Ex3Cstrongx3ELess flexiblex3C/strongx3E: Sprocs can take full advantage of a databasex27s featureset.  LINQ tends to be more generic in itx27s support.  This is common in any kind of language abstraction (e.g. C# vs assembler).x3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Ex3Cstrongx3ERecompilingx3C/strongx3E: If you need to make changes to the way you do data access, you need to recompile, version, and redeploy your assembly.  Sprocs can x3Cemx3Esometimesx3C/emx3E allow a DBA to tune the data access routine without a need to redeploy anything.x3C/lix3E\nx3C/olx3E\n\nx3Cpx3ESecurity and manageability are something that people argue about too.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Colx3E\nx3Clix3Ex3Cstrongx3ESecurityx3C/strongx3E: For example, you can protect your sensitive data by restricting access to the tables directly, and put ACLs on the sprocs.  With LINQ, however, you can still restrict direct access  to tables and instead put ACLs on updatable table x3Cemx3Eviewsx3C/emx3E to achieve a similar end (assuming your database supports updatable views).  x3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Ex3Cstrongx3EManageabilityx3C/strongx3E: Using views also gives you the advantage of shielding your application non-breaking from schema changes (like table normalization).  You can update the view without requiring your data access code to change.x3C/lix3E\nx3C/olx3E\n\nx3Cpx3EI used to be a big sproc guy, but Ix27m starting to lean towards LINQ as a better alternative in general.  If there are some areas where sprocs are clearly better, then Ix27ll probably still write a sproc but access it using LINQ. :)x3C/px3E',165,0,'2008-08-27 00:04:51'),(180,'nivakhnov17','x3Cpx3EYou can change the location the project compliers and saves the dcu/unit/exe to in Project/Options under the Directories/Conditionals is that what you are looking for? x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EI bevile there is also some settings for the DBE in the Tools menu, but I dont have them install at the moment (or i cant find them)x3C/px3E',0,0,'2008-08-26 19:37:05'),(180,'scurraghy','x3Cpx3EActually, by colllapsing the colums you already summed them, so the dimension doesnx27t matter at all for your example.

OpenGL extensions are listed in the x3Ca href=x22http://www.opengl.org/registry/x22x3EOpenGL Extension Registryx3C/ax3E.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3ECheck if your graphic card supports the extensions you wish to use.

Alternatively, you can also place the x3Cstrongx3Eglew32.dllx3C/strongx3E in a directory where Windows picks up its DLLs.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EAdd the GLEW x3Cstrongx3Eincludex3C/strongx3E path to your compilerx27s include directory list.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EAdd the GLEW x3Cstrongx3Elibx3C/strongx3E path to your compilerx27s library directory list.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EInstruct your compiler to use x3Cstrongx3Eglew32.libx3C/strongx3E during linking. If youx27re using Visual C++ compilers then one way to do this is by adding the following line to your code:x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cprex3Ex3Ccodex3E#pragma comment(lib, x22glew32.libx22)\nx3C/codex3Ex3C/prex3E\n\nx3Cpx3EAdd a x3Ccodex3E#include x26lt;GL/glew.hx26gt;x3C/codex3E line to your code. Ensure that this is placed above the includes of other GL header files. (You may actually not need the GL header files includes if you include x3Ccodex3Eglew.hx3C/codex3E.)x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EInitialize GLEW using x3Ccodex3EglewInit()x3C/codex3E after youx27ve initialized GLUT or GL.

I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.

It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.x3C/px3E\n\n\n\nx3Cpx3E[Edit]\n\n@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:x3C/px3E\n\n\n\nx3Cblockquotex3E\n\n  x3Cpx3EFor example, there is an issue known as a x22hotspotx22, where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the tablex27s data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.x3C/px3E\n\n  \n\n  x3Cpx3EAlso, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.x3C/px3E\n\n  \n\n  x3Cpx3EIf you even x3Cemx3Ethinkx3C/emx3E you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.x3C/px3E\n\n  \n\n  x3Cpx3EYet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by x3Cemx3Ethisx3C/emx3E server, but all values generated by x3Cemx3Eallx3C/emx3E computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new recordx27s permanent key value at the time the record is created. x3C/px3E\n\n  \n\n  x3Cpx3Ex3Ca href=x22http://forums.asp.net/t/264350.aspxx22x3Ehttp://forums.asp.net/t/264350.aspxx3C/ax3Ex3C/px3E\n\nx3C/blockquotex3E',31,0,'2008-08-08 07:04:29'),(41580,'sdally1','x3Cpx3EI would imagine then if you have an application with some 3rd party components you may be stuffed.

Additionally, I wanted to have the opportunity to replace the functionality altogether if the need or desire arose (such as if the memcached servers are down for some reason, we could potentially hot swap with a local cache implementation instead).x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EI exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client API, and it would have been awesome to extend the client API class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface.  The methods that I had in the interface that matched the actual interface would then need no further details and so I wouldnx27t have to explicitly implement them.  However, the class was sealed, so I had to instead proxy calls to an internal reference to this class.  The result: more work and a lot more code for no real good reason.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EThat said, I think there are potential times when you might want to make a class sealed... and the best thing I can think of is an API that you will invoke directly, but allow clients to implement.  For example, a game where you can program against the game... if your classes were not sealed, then the players who are adding features could potentially exploit the API to their advantage.  This is a very narrow case though, and I think any time you have full control over the codebase, there really is little if any reason to make a class sealed.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EThis is one reason I really like the Ruby programming language... even the core classes are open, not just to extend but to ADD AND CHANGE functionality dynamically, TO THE CLASS ITSELF!  Itx27s called monkeypatching and can be a nightmare if abused, but itx27s damn fun to play with!x3C/px3E',1,0,'2008-08-24 01:57:11'),(42950,'tvallentint','x3Cpx3E+1 for separation.

I am aware that Microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a SSRS report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute.  However sometimes gargantuan reports are a preferred evil due to external forces such complying with state laws.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EAt my place of employment, we have an asp.net (2.0) app that we have migrated from Crystal Reports to SSRS. Due to the large user base and complex reporting UI requirements we have a set of screens that accepts user inputted parameters and creates schedules to be run over night. Since the application supports multiple reporting frameworks we do not use the scheduling/snapshot facilities of SSRS. All of the reports in the system are generated by a scheduled console app which takes user entered parameters and generates the reports with the corresponding reporting solutions the reports were created with. In the case of SSRS reports, the console app generates the SSRS reports and exports them as PDFs via the SSRS web service API. x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3ESo far SSRS has been much easier to deal with than Crystal with the exception of a certain 25,000 page report that we have recently converted from crystal reports to SSRS. The SSRS server is a 64bit 2003 server with 32 gigs of ram running SSRS 2005. All of our smaller reports work fantastically, but we are having trouble with our larger reports such as this one.  Unfortunately, we canx27t seem to generate the aforemention report through the web service API. The following error occurs roughly 30-35 minutes into the generation/export:x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EException Message: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EThe web service call is something Ix27m sure you all have seen before:  x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cprex3Ex3Ccodex3Edata = rs.Render(this.ReportPath, this.ExportFormat, null, deviceInfo,\n   selectedParameters, null, null, out encoding, out mimeType, out usedParameters, \n   out warnings, out streamIds);\nx3C/codex3Ex3C/prex3E\n\nx3Cpx3EThe odd thing is that this report will run/render/export if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager. The proc that produces the data for the report runs for about 5 minutes. The report renders in SSRS native format in the browser/viewer after about 12 minutes. Exporting to pdf through the browser/viewer in the report manager takes an additional 55 minutes. This works reliably and it produces a whopping 1.03gb pdf.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EHere are some of the more obvious things Ix27ve tried to get the report working via the web service API:  x3C/px3E\n\nx3Culx3E\nx3Clix3Eset the HttpRuntime ExecutionTimeout\nvalue to 3 hours on the report\nserverx3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Edisabled http keep alives on the report serverx3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Eincreased the script timeout on the report serverx3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Eset the report to never time out on the serverx3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3Eset the report timeout to several hours on the client call  x3C/lix3E\nx3C/ulx3E\n\nx3Cpx3EFrom the tweaks I have tried, I am fairly comfortable saying that any timeout issues have been eliminated. x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EBased off of my research of the error message, I believe that the web service API does not send chunked responses by default. This means that it tries to send all 1.3gb over the wire in one response. At a certain point, IIS throws in the towel. Unfortunately the API abstracts away web service configuration so I canx27t seem to find a way to enable response chunking. x3C/px3E\n\nx3Colx3E\nx3Clix3EDoes anyone know of anyway to reduce/optimize the PDF export phase and or the size of the PDF without lowering the total page count?x3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3EIs there a way to turn on response chunking for SSRS?x3C/lix3E\nx3Clix3EDoes anyone else have any other theories as to why this runs on the server but not through the API?x3C/lix3E\nx3C/olx3E\n\nx3Cpx3EEDIT: After reading kcrumleyx27s post I began to take a look at the average page size by taking file size / page count. Interestingly enough on smaller reports the math works out so that each page is roughly 5K. Interestingly, when the report gets larger this x22averagex22 increases. An 8000 page report for example is averaging over 40K/page. Very odd. I will also add that the number of records per page is set except for the last page in each grouping, so itx27s not a case where some pages have more records than another. x3C/px3E',1,2,'erowcliffe1d','2008-08-19 02:19:16'),(15390,'Best practices for managing and deploying large JavaScript apps','x3Cpx3EWhat are some standard practices for managing a medium-large JavaScript application?

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EIx27ve written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of x22re-usex22 the reality is that unless a piece of code does x3Cemx3Eexactlyx3C/emx3E what you want it to do, therex27s very little cost-effective x22re-usex22.  Itx27s extremely hard to design classes to be extensible x3Cemx3Ein the right wayx3C/emx3E, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that x22re-usex22 simply isnx27t worthwhile.x3C/px3E\n\nx3Cpx3EIn many regards, this doesnx27t surprise me.  The real world isnx27t x22OOx22, and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someonex27s lap--but not one of those is-a chair).
